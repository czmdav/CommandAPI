# Maven

A simple example of making a plugin that uses the CommandAPI with Maven.

Key points:

- The `commandapi-velocity-core` dependency is used with the provided scope
```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>dev.jorel</groupId>
	<artifactId>commandapi-velocity-core</artifactId>
	<version>9.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
	<scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```
- In the `@Plugin` annotation, `commandapi` is listed as a dependency:
```java
@Plugin(id = "maven-example", description = "An example for using the CommandAPI with maven",
// Add a dependency on the CommandAPI
dependencies = {@Dependency(id = "commandapi")})
```
