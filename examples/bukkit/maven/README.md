# Maven

A simple example of making a plugin that uses the CommandAPI with Maven.

Key points:

- The `commandapi-bukkit-plugin` dependency is used with the provided scope
```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>dev.jorel</groupId>
	<artifactId>commandapi-bukkit-plugin</artifactId>
	<version>9.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
	<scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```
- In the plugin.yml, CommandAPI is listed as a depend:
```yaml
depend:
    - CommandAPI
```
- Classes from the NBT API can be accessed in `dev.jorel.commandapi.nbtapi`
